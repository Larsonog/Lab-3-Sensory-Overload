# Over Expose Journal

A Flutter Photo Journal.

## Photo Journal

Our app is a riff on a new, popular app BeReal. In the app BeReal, users are prompted to take pictures of their activities throughout the day with random notificatons. Our app is a simple version of this; users allowed to add pictures and descriptions of key activities in a day. 

Anyone who owns a phone with a camera can use our app. It is a useful way to keep track of daily activities and to save memories. 

Our app allows users to take photos of an activity that they are doing. They are then able to add a description of the activity and add it to the corresponding day.

This is the Home page of our app. The + button at the bottom takes user directly to the camera.

This is the camera screen of the app. After the picture is taken, users can add the title and description for the event.

After finishing the entry, it is visible on the home page.

## Testing our app

Due to the use of the camera plugin, the emulated phone cannot be a Google Pixel.
